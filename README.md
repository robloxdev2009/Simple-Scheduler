**Simple Scheduler**

A simple scheduling tool that schedules events on command!

**How to use:**

simply run the ```.new``` function with your target function as the first argument:

```local Scheduler = require(script.Scheduler).new(function(arg1, arg2) print("Hello world!", arg1, arg2) end)```

to use the function, call either Every or After with at least one argument, the number of seconds to wait:

```Scheduler:After(5, false, "Hello world, again!", "Hello world, for a third time!")```

the second argument is an optional callback that runs every frame while waiting. if you donâ€™t need it, you can either leave it out or just set it to false.

any other arguments will be passed into:

- the per-frame callback, if included
- the main function you gave to .new once the time is up
